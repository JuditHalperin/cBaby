# cBaby

**cBaby** – OrCam's hackathon 2022 challenge – uses computer vision and speech recognition technologies to keep sleeping babies safe and help worried disabled parents.

Using a contact-free camera placed above the bed, the algorithm detects whenever there is a blanket over the baby's head, he has seizures, or his face turns blue or pale.

The user interface and the alert are both verbal and visual, thus accessible for people with disabilities.
